- Optimized "get_dimensionality" and "get_base_name".
  (Issue #166 and #167, thanks jbmohler)
- Renamed ureg.parse_units parameter "to_delta" to "as_delta" to make clear 
  that no conversion happens. Accordingly, the parameter/property 
  "default_to_delta" of UnitRegistry was renamed to "default_as_delta".
  (Issue #158, thanks dalit)
- Fixed problem when adding two uncertainties.
  (thanks dalito)
- Full support for Offset units (e.g. temperature)
